I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at [Rutgers Business School](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty/hangcheng-zhao). My research focuses on pricing, algorithmic decision-making, and the business impact of generative AI. I received my Ph.D. in [quantitative marketing](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/phd-program-in-marketing/) from the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of the University of Pennsylvania.
