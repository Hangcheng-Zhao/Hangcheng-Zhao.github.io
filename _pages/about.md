I am a Ph.D. candidate in [quantitative marketing](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/phd-program-in-marketing/) at the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of University of Pennsylvania. I work on empirical analysis of pricing and algorithmic decision-making. My research goal is to understand how firms can leverage various algorithms to increase their profits, assess the impacts on pricing and information in the market, and recommend strategies to sellers, platform managers, and policymakers. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Tsinghua Unversity](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and a Master's degree from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en).
