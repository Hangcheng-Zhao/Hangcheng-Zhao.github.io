I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Rutgers Business School. I work on empirical analysis of pricing and algorithmic decision-making. My research goal is to understand how firms can leverage various algorithms to increase their profits, assess the impacts on pricing and information in the market, and recommend strategies to sellers, platform managers, and policymakers. I received my Ph.D. in [quantitative marketing](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/phd-program-in-marketing/) from the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of the University of Pennsylvania.
