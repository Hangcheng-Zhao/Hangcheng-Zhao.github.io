I am a fourth-year Ph.D. in quantitative marketing at the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania. 

I work on pricing and I study the relationship between pricing and information in emerging markets and in the context of contemporary techniques. I am interested in exploring the potential limitations of this relationship.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua Unversity and Master's degree from the University of Chicago.
