<h2>Social Media Marketing — Spring 2026</h2>
<p>Undergraduate &amp; Master's, Rutgers Business School</p>

<h3>Case Discussion Board</h3>
<p>
  To make case discussions more interactive and engaging, I built a <a href="https://case-discussion-board.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Case Discussion Board</a> web app. The instructor structures a case into sequential questions, and students respond live on their devices. Responses appear on a shared board projected in the classroom, supporting sentiment word clouds, open-ended text responses, and live polls. The project is open source on <a href="https://github.com/Hangcheng-Zhao/case-discussion-board" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
