## Social Media Marketing — Spring 2026

I teach Social Media Marketing for undergraduate and master's students at Rutgers Business School.

The course examines how companies leverage social media platforms for marketing strategy, brand building, and customer engagement. Students analyze real-world cases and develop hands-on social media campaigns.

### Case Discussion Board

To facilitate in-class case discussions, I built an interactive <a href="https://case-discussion-board.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Case Discussion Board</a> — a real-time classroom tool designed for case-method teaching.

**How it works:** The instructor structures a case into a sequence of discussion questions organized by topic (called "pastures" in the board plan). During class, students respond to each question on their devices. Responses appear live on a shared board projected in the classroom, enabling real-time analysis and dialogue.

**Question types:**
- **Sentiment** — Students complete a prompt (e.g., "TikTok is...") and responses are automatically classified as positive, negative, or neutral, displayed as a color-coded word cloud
- **Text** — Open-ended discussion questions displayed as a word cloud
- **Poll** — Multiple-choice questions with live bar chart results

**Board plan example (TikTok case):**
- *Opening* — Sentiment check: first impressions of TikTok
- *Pasture 1: TikTok's Rise* — What drove rapid growth, interface design, cold start pool
- *Pasture 2: Business Model* — Key revenue components, competitive moats, strategic implications
- *Pasture 3: Regulation* — Douyin vs. TikTok, should TikTok be banned (poll), regulatory approaches

The instructor controls the pace from a separate panel — advancing questions, revealing responses, and toggling between controlled and live display modes.
