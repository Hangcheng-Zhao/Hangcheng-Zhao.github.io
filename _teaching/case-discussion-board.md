## Case Discussion Board

An interactive, real-time classroom discussion tool designed for case-method teaching. Instructors create structured case discussions with multiple question types, and students respond live during class. Responses are displayed on a shared board for real-time analysis and classroom dialogue.

### Features

- **Multi-step discussions** — Structure your case into sequential questions organized by topic (e.g., "Opening", "Business Model", "Regulation")
- **Three question types** — Text responses, sentiment analysis (with automatic positive/negative/neutral classification and word cloud visualization), and live polls with bar chart results
- **Real-time board** — A shared display that updates live as students submit responses, designed for projection in the classroom
- **Instructor controls** — Advance steps, reveal responses on the board, toggle between controlled and live display modes
- **Multi-section support** — Run the same case across multiple class sections (e.g., Section A, B, C) with independent session tracking
- **No student accounts required** — Students simply enter their name and start responding

### How It Works

1. **Create a case** at the landing page with a unique ID and title
2. **Configure** your discussion steps, topics, and question types in the Setup page
3. **Share the student link** with your class (e.g., `/c/your-case/A` for Section A)
4. **Control the discussion** from the Instructor panel — advance questions, reveal answers on the board
5. **Project the board** in the classroom to display student responses in real time
